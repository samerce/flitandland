HELP BUILD AN ART-FIRST MOVEMENT
express your mess!
we're all a little queer,
let your funky bits hang out.
(he)art freed.
community and commodity as one.
being while becoming.
aiming at a woke world
while living loud proud present with what is
creating space as art:
intimate, specific,
sexy geometry,
intoxicating complexity,
infinitely emerging ecstatic politics fruiting exotic artistic works.
personal â€”> political â€”> art â€”> culture â€”> life,
a radical renegotiation of space.
and of time spent.

WITH LOFTY GOALS
are you new orleans' next cultural icon? will you be the first drag queen to run for president?
pursuit is messy. to taste what's possible, we must pull at the root of education. what does being a person mean?
we want to endlessly explore. we want to empower badasses to run with deep vision. & we're using our home as a living laboratory to perfect some theories.
through art â€” movies, photography, painting, ideas, politics, happenings, holding space, and gentle rebellion . . . we're telling a story of liberation.
ready to get lofty?
IN SHORT
be queer.
be honest, reflective, & playful.
be eager to build something beautiful.
be available to move in this week and set up the art booth for southern decadence !
â†’ ignite enthusiasm, be electric.
â†’ emanate joy together.
â†’ move fluidly, with one mind; osmosis.
YOU GON BE BUSY, HENNIE !

then drop back into nourishment. into some conjured hip space to be, no questions asked. into a place where nothing needs to be done. and all is self-so actualization, actualizing.
eym.com is a place to let your insides hang out. can we challenge the audience while also pleasing them?
one simple question: can we make room for what is and wants to be?
reality is ginormous.
moveable price tags. value as a sensation, something felt.
our aim is freedom. which is a very solo act.
the physical work, the sum total of sensate antics, are secondary to the spiritual upheaval
consciously choosing creative rebirth is a richness that resides outside of productivity and bank accounts.
that said, we need someone ready to werq.
someone who dreams in Big Vision but is addicted to getting their hands dirty and making things happen.
someone compelling and ready to change their lives forever. & gracious enough to take everyone else on the journey."}
