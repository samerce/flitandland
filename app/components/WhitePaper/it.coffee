        you know what sucks?<br/>
        poverty. racism. genocide. pollution.<br/>
        <E>oppression.</E>
      </p>
      <p>
        you know what {"doesn't"} suck?<br/>
        love. joy. curiosity. creation. ecstasy.<br/>
        <E>life.</E>
      </p>
      <p>
        our global consternation may be eased by the small tasks. looking inward without external expectation, taking space and time to rest at peace on a baseline of being wholly satisfied just by <E>existing</E>, celebrating for the sake of it. everything beautiful flows.
      </p>
      <p>
      <E>how is it that our country makes enough food to feed the entire nation twice over and yet has millions of hungry people?</E>
      </p>
      <p>
        we are sad. and we teach our children to be exactly the same way. an endless cycle.<br/>
        {"here's"} one way to escape: grant permission to <E>adults</E> to step out of competition with one another and recover the childhood awe and wonder that imbues kids with that constant energy that all grown-ups envy.
      </p>
      <p><E>hey adults, {"let's"} play!</E></p>
      <p>
        imagine if adults poured onto the streets everyday to play, create, and sing! imagine if they were granted space & time to just be without expectation, on a regular basis. imagine that this regular explosion of light, ecstasy, and joy trickled into their soul depths and eliminated their baseline sadness. what kind of parents could they be then?<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        what kind of kids would they raise?
      </p>
      <p>
        our guess is that {"they'd"} be the best generation {"we've"} ever seen: a genius combination of light-heartedness, compassionate awareness, explosive joy, and mindful care. we can create a better future for our kids by creating a better <E>now</E> for <i>ourselves</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        BOOM! POW! ZING!<br/>
        <E>flit & land is born!</E>
      </p>
      <p>
        adults! you are now granted permission to get out into the streets and play with life! {"you're"} invited, baby! — leave your 9-to-5, become a flitterer, and spread love, joy, light, and creativity all day, everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href='https://expressyourmess.com'>express your mess</a> publicly and show yourself, the world, and <i>your kids</i> what it means to draw power from the zero-point energy of pure existence.

        {"don't"} you wanna live in a world where a quartet roams the streets singing gorgeous songs to passersby?
      </p>
      <p>
        {"don't"} you wanna live in a world where a drag queen sets up on the corner every tuesday to teach juggling while giving voice lessons?
      </p>
      <p>
        {"don't"} you wanna live in a world where bankers & baristas get together to embody philosophers from the past and discuss existentialism while practicing acro-yoga on the beach?
      </p>
      <p>we do!</p>
      <p>
        {"don't"} you wanna live in a world where democracy is defended against tyranny with fabulous faeries inciting dialogue between ethnically & culturally diverse groups?
      </p>
      <p>
        {"don't"} you wanna live in a world where public discourse is something to look forward to and celebrate rather than dread and denigrate?
      </p>
      <p>
        {"don't"} you wanna live in a world where being cut off in traffic {"doesn't"} lead to screams, threats, fists or gunshots?
      </p>
      <p>we do!</p>
      <p>
        we envision a <E>flit and land</E> chapter in every city—flitterings planned for every day of the week, bringing a relentless, militant, extravagant joy to the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        using found items, thrift store treasures, and donations, flitterers stage dramatically bold events that aim to invigorate, educate, and soothe the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        every month, flitterers will be automatically entered for a chance to win a trip to another state, accompanied by three other faeries—cross-pollinating cultural bubbles and healing our divides with joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        as their confidence grows, flitterers are given more resources to take on larger projects, maybe turning a street block into a massive group body paint, or maybe building the {"world's"} largest LED adult jungle gym at the local park. and finally, once {"#flitlife"} obviously outshines {"#corporatehell"}, flitterers can request a salary and flit full time!
      </p>
      <p>long live joy!</p>
